            <h3> Greetings, welcome to my UTCS webpage! 🤘 </h3>
          </header>
          <p> My name is Omeed Tehrani. Think of it like, "OH!" + "MEED". It is okay if you put emphasis on the O, it makes saying my name kind of fun. I am a student and an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in the Department
            of Computer Science at UT. Nice to meet you! </p>
          <h5>About Me</h5>
            <p> I was born and raised in Austin, TX, but most of my family is overseas. Since I was a child, I have loved traveling and flying. My favorite airlines are
              <a href = "https://www.lufthansa.com/us/en/homepage"> Lufthansa</a> and <a href = "https://www.klm.com/"> KLM</a>, not only because of the service but the overall comfort and flying experience. As of present day, I have been to Amsterdam, Germany, Iran, Las Vegas, Canada & New York.
              My dad also studied in France, so I hope to visit there some day. I enjoy playing Call of Duty (Cold War Zombies & MW), Among Us, Minecraft and The Last of Us. I watch a lot of Gordon Ramsey on Hulu (such as MasterChef and HK), and I used
            to watch The Office on Netflix before they removed it on New Years Day. </p>
            <p> I am currently in the process of completing my B.S in Computer Science. I absolutely love creating applications and software that contain life improving components.
              I take old, outdated and misused features of modern applications, and look for new innovative ways to refresh the UI or functionality. </p>
              <p>I also spend a great deal of time trading in the stock market and trading cryptocurrencies. I am highly invested in the rise of Artificial Intelligence/Quantum Computing, including the roles they play in market volatility, institutional/hedgefund growth and overall trading ethics. I am also very interested in Quantum Computing's impact in blockchain mining. </p>
          <!-- <p>Outside of my studying, I love developing new skillsets. It is wonderful the kind of resources that are available to developers on the internet.
             This includes exploring new frameworks (such as Ruby on Rails, Qiskit, Django & React), creating & analyzing Artificial Intelligence driven stock trading software, and developing multi-component based mobile/web applications.</p> -->

          <p>Currently, I am actively looking for a software engineering internship for Summer 2021. Aside from interning for a UT startup as a software developer,
            I am the founder/creator of <a href = "https://www.cs312hub.com">cs312hub</a>, a developer for the Neumonic project and in the process of creating a small SaaS company that will launch early 2021.</p>


          <!-- <p style="text-align:center;"><a class="btn-draw" href="http://blog.alokprateek.in"><span>Read My
                Blog</span></a></p> -->

          <p>I've also decided to begin recruiting developers and graphic designers for my company, so please reach out to my email with a descriptive subject line if you are interested. This option is unavailable to current CS312 students. </p>

         <div>
         <h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
         <p>At UTCS, academic dishonesty is not taken lightly. Many who are in the UT Computer Science department, go on to work at big technology companies, study at top ranked graduate schools, write famous research papers, start their own companies, and the list goes on. The reason these things are possible is because of the outstanding talent/success of students and faculty, and  the reputation that a degree from UTCS holds. In order to maintain this reputation, students in UTCS are held to a high standard of academic integrity. This class can get quite challenging, especially for students who are newer to Java. If at ANY point in the semester, you feel the temptation to cheat, the best thing to do is speak to an instructor about your struggles and find ways to fill gaps in your knowledge and be successful on exams or assignments without having to face the consequences of academic dishonesty. Remember, it is better to get a zero on an assignment than to cheat. A single instance of cheating will lead to a reduction of your final course grade to F (failing), and several other consequences. </p>
         <p> <em>If you have not already, I would encourage you to study up on these informational pages on academic integrity.</em></p>

            <h4>Transferring into UTCS</h4>
            <img src = "https://cns.utexas.edu/images/CNS/Alumni/internal_transfer_CNS.jpg" width = "100%" />
            <small style = "font-size: 15px"> <em> Image Credit: This image is from the UT CNS Internal Transfer website. The internal transfer into the Department of Computer Science is handled by the College of Natural Sciences. </em></small>
            <p>
              <p> <b>DISCLAIMER:</b> The entire transfer process is between you and the College of Natural Sciences - we have absolutely nothing to do with the transfer process. A lot of your more personal or in-depth question answers can be found on CNS pages, FAQ's, and from CNS admissions staff. Google will be your best friend in this process. :)</p>

            <p>Although this course isn't just for prospect transfers, for the majority of students, the end goal of this course is to successfully transfer into UT's Computer Science program.
               Being that this department is <a href = "https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings"> top 10 ranked</a> in the nation, the process is quite rigorous, challenging and competitive.
            I want you to know that I completely understand how overwhelming the process can be. Trying to balance school work with extracurriculars, projects, and internships can be hard.</p>

          <p></p>
          <p> If you have any additional questions, please do not hestitate to email me or privately post on Piazza. I will try my best to point you to the right resource if I do not have an answer of my own. Best of luck in the process!  </p>
              <p> Cheers to the beginning of a wonderful semester and an even better 2021!</p>
